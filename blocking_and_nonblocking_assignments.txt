1) HDLs support blocking and nonblocking assignments in an [always/
process] statement. A group of blocking assignments are evaluated in the
order in which they appear in the code, just as one would expect in a standard
programming language. A group of nonblocking assignments are
evaluated concurrently; all of the statements are evaluated before any of
the signals on the left hand sides are updated.

2) In a SystemVerilog [always] statement, = indicates a blocking
assignment and <= indicates a nonblocking assignment (also
called a concurrent assignment).
Do not confuse either type with continuous assignment
using the [assign] statement. [assign] statements must be used outside
[always] statements and are also evaluated concurrently.

DATA TYPES
1)Nearly all SystemVerilog signals can be [logic]. The exception is 
that signals with multiple drivers (e.g., a tristate bus) must be declared as a net.

2)When a [tri] net is driven to a single value by one or more drivers, it
takes on that value. When it is undriven, it floats (z). When it is driven to
a different value (0, 1, or x) by multiple drivers, it is in contention (x).

3)There are other net types that resolve differently when undriven or
driven by multiple sources. (Page 214)
